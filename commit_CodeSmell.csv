"[1120417] Break up transaction of updatePluginConfigurationDefinition into smaller pieces Another pass here given some oracle test failures in the CI env. - Fix an issue with PropertyDefinitionSimple.removeEnumeratedValues.   An unexpected problem brought out, I guess, by the Tx reworking,   must be careful not to replace hibernate proxy dealing with   orphanRemoval. - remove unnecessary REQUIRES_NEW that could lead to locking issues - remove some dead code - start shortening xxxInNewTransaction to xxxInNewTx, purely for selfish reasons."

HEAD - removing dead code
"Instead of initializing imported classes immediately, they are only initialized if constants (heuristic: upper case!) are used. Static method and constructor calls are intercepted by a class-initializing wrapper method, anyway. This makes lazy class initialization effective! It may also allow later to introduce extended scopes (*-imports, same package, statics of super classes) when preloading all classes. All Jangaroo examples and Jangaron have been adapted to work with the new semantics."

Removed a lot of duplicate code in the CommandManagers Added missing cmds. Removed useless code.
"Massive update. - Infractions now is split into 3 parts. -- **Base** contains the main, cross-platform data classes that are shared between all implementations. -- **Bungee** is the default implementation as a BungeeCord plugin. -- **Spigot API** is an API that exists to allow for plugins to hook into Infractions from their spigot/bukkit plugins. - It is intended that individual servers will have their own take on Infractions, and thus a mere config file is unsuited for the majority of features (a la the Chitchat plugin). -- In this case, there is no default spigot/bukkit implementation, only an API that exists for accessing/manipulating the data. - Groundwork has been laid for the bungee plugin, various commands will be shared between servers. -- Many of these commands will probably be moved to the spigot API or completely removed (as we want each server to have their own implementation). - A default/barebones implementation for spigot/bukkit *may* exist in the future."

Fix dead code bug
"MATH-439 Refactored the ""solvers"" package. Implementations refer to number of evaluation of the objective function (instead of the number of iterations). New interfaces and base classes. ""NewtonSolver"" fits in the design without resorting to a cast. Created class ""MullerSolver2"" to contain the code of the method named ""solve2"" in class ""MullerSolver"". Removed ""UnivariateRealSolverFactory"" and ""UnivariateRealSolverFactoryImpl"". Default solver in ""UnivariateRealSolverUtils"" is explicitely instantiated. ""AbstractContinuousDistribution"": Type of exception thrown changed in ""UnivariateRealSolverUtils"". Factored out duplicate code (in ""GaussNewtonOptimizerTest"" and ""LevenbergMarquardtOptimizerTest""): class ""Circle"" is now called ""CircleVectorial"". Also factored out the ""Circle"" class from ""NonLinearConjugateGradientOptimizerTest"": class is named ""CircleScalar"". Created ""SecantSolverTest"", moving there all the tests for the class ""SecantSolver"" that were located in class ""BrentSolverTest"". Created new interface and base class for polynomial functions solvers (""LaguerreSolver"") so that the function type is now checked at compile time. Removed deprecated exceptions (MATH-441). Javadoc clean-up. Lowered tolerance values in some unit tests. Tests upgraded to Junit 4 (MATH-423)."

TEIIDDES-1046 Enabling REST for Procedures that were RESTful in 7.4.2 Leaves the Legacy Tags. Changed the action to enable REST to only enable if there are no new REST extension properties and no old 7.4 REST extension properties.

merge duplicate code
"Decided to take the pain and refactor the parlor.game and parlor.turn packages properly into client, data and server subpackages. This eliminates a bunch of hackery I had to do to properly handle dead code removal when building the Game Gardens client and games and it simplifies things and sets a good example to follow the standard procedure as much as possible."

Add a generic method to calculate percentages to avoid duplicate code.
"- Moves LabelFinder to hudson.model, as its a core facility, not necessarily a   task or even slave related. - Removes all caching of labels. Slow extensions can cache (see nodetags). - Pulls up common implementations of getAssignedLabels and an immutable   getDynamicLabels facility into Node. getDynamicLabels was previously public,   but never exported. - factored out some trivially duplicated code into Node.getHudsonlabel - changes LabelFinder to return Collection<Label> as that is the data that   higher layers want to work with, and there is no good reason to force lookups   when implementations can and should cache themselves. - Deletes OSLabeler, a disabled version of the LabelFinder extension point -   there is no need for dead code to be keep in the tree."

core: Move common duplicate code to a method in HotPlugDiskToVmCommandTest
hacky code! Added joins and wrote an algorithm to group joins in clusters that don't need intra-fieldsGrouping. One MultiJoin bolt is created per cluster which is essentially a sub-rete-network within the outter rete-network. At the moment there are many static methods in the wrong places which should go into a toolbox for datastructure-operations. There's also some duplicate code that needs to be factored away.
